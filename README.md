This mini project presents the development of a web application designed for data visualization
and image transformation. Leveraging the Flask web framework, Pandas for data processing,
Matplotlib for chart generation, and OpenCV for image manipulation, the application provides
users with a versatile platform for interacting with both structured data and image files.

The steps to implement the program are as follows:
1. Open terminal at the folder where the files related to the program are saved.
2. Execute the program by using the command "python3 <file_name>.py. This will
make the program up and running
3. Now open any browser and type the address as "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
4. Now you can browse and upload the kind of image you want. On pressing
Upload, if image format is permissible then the next webpage will open
depending on the type of file
5. If the file is a csv file with 2 columns, the next page will contain the bar and pie
charts plotted for it.
6. If the file is an image, then it will be converted to grayscale and shown to you
along with a button to download the image in the desired location.
